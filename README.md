## Introduction

This application is the result of an exercise in discovering and determining
best practices in developing single-page applications for the web. I am learning
how best to employ the following technologies in conjunction with one another:

- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/);
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/);
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/);
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/); and
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/),

within the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[ECMAScript](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262) environments.
